===============================================ABSTRACTION============================================================

1.What is Abstraction ?
-> Abstraction is used to show only the functionality and hide the unnecessary implementation to user.

ex : car while driving you just need steering and accelerator brake and clutch.

2. Why abstraction is needed in java.?
-> To reduce complexity by hiding the unnecessary details
-> to increase the security by showing only necessary details


3.How Abstraction can be achieved in java.
-> In java Abstraction can be achieved in two ways.
   using class ----> 0-100% we can achieve in some cases
   using interface ---->(100% abstraction before java 8)

4.Abstract Class :
 --> The class which is declared with the keyword abstract.
   Abstract class can have both methods :
  ----> unimplemented abstract methods
  ----> implemented non-abstract methods 


5.Rules to Achieve Abstraction
   -->cannot initiated directly bcz (we cant create the object of abstract class)
  --> Can hava abstract and non -abstract methods
  --> can have constructors and variables
  --> the subclass must be declared as abstract or it must be implemented.

 
| Feature         | Abstract Class                                | Interface                                                                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Methods**     | Can have both abstract & non-abstract methods | Only abstract methods (before Java 8), default & static methods allowed after Java 8 |
| **Variables**   | Can have instance variables                   | Only `public static final` constants                                                 |
| **Inheritance** | Supports single inheritance                   | Supports multiple inheritance                                                        |
| **Use Case**    | When you want partial abstraction             | When you want complete abstraction                                                   |
| **Constructor** | Can have constructors                         | Cannot have constructors                                                             |

6. Advantages of Abstraction

Reduces code complexity.
Improves maintainability.
Increases security (hides implementation).
Supports modular design.
